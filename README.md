Brief Summary:
    Our project will, in short, be a pseudo-Mario: A platformer that allows the player to complete levels that mimic those of a 1985 Mario game. This project will allow the player to operate the Mario avatar to move in various ways to overcome all obstacles, with the goal to reach the flag at the end of the level. We will code this project in Java processing to emphasize the graphics component of the project.

Development Log:
    Kelly Yu
      5/23: I have changed the name of the World class to Level. I have created the skeleton of Game & Level classes that we have planned so far. Additionally, I have begun completing the setup method in Game & the constructor for Level.

      5/24: I have created Entity & edited the Asset class. I have tested out the constructors of these classes in Game

      5/25: I have created Player & have begun coding for the player to move. I have added methods and fields to various classes to better help figure out the player's location and movement.

      5/26: I have changed all the fields to become public. I have started on the movement controls, but have faced some problems trying to implement the controls and will probably model after the class example tomorrow.

      5/27: I have changed the controls to keep track of multiple keys. The player can now move left and right but has problems with displaying the correct direction to face. Player will display the correct sprite for each action (but still may need fixing). I seem to be having problems running the code though.

      5/30: The player can now move around, but doesn't change sprite based on movement. The player is blocked by boundaries of the screen but no the blocks.

        5/23: I have begun to write the skeletons for the Asset class instance variables and methods we have planned.
