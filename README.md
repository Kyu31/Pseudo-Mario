# Pseudo-Mario

Group: The Construction Workers
Kelly Yu & Emily Young-squire

Brief Summary:
    Our project will, in short, be a pseudo-Mario: A platformer that allows the player to complete levels that mimic those of a 1985 Mario game. This project will allow the player to operate the Mario avatar to move in various ways to overcome all obstacles, with the goal to reach the flag at the end of the level. We will code this project in Java processing to emphasize the graphics component of the project.
